    The wolf went to the straw house, and said
    "Little pig, little pig, let me come in".
    The little pig replied "No, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin".

    To which the wolf replied
    "Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in".

    And the wolf huffed and he puffed, and blew the house down.
    And the first little pig ran to his brother's house of sticks.

    So, the wolf went to the stick house, and said
    "Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in".
    "No, not by the hair of our chinny chin chins", replied the pigs.

    "Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in"

    So, the wolf huffed and puffed, and blew the house down.
    And the little pigs ran to their brother's house of bricks.

    So, the wolf went to the brick house, and said
    "Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in".
    "No, not by the hair of our chinny chin chins", replied the pigs.

    "Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in"

    So, the wolf huffed and puffed, and huffed and puffed,
    but he could not blow the house down.

    The wolf searched for a way into the house.
    He tried the door and the windows, but the pigs had closed them.
    But, he saw that the chimney was open,
    and jumped on the roof to climb down it.

    But, the three little pigs saw what the wolf was planning.
    So, they hung a big pot of water on the fireplace hearth,
    and made up a blazing fire.

    The wolf climbed into the open chimney, and prepared to slide down
    the chute.

    The wolf slid down the chimney, and straight into the pot of water,
    where he was promptly boiled up.

    "That's the end of the Big Bad Wolf", said one of the pigs,
    and they all lived happily ever after.
