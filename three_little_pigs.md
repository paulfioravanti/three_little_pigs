1. Once upon a time, there was a mother pig.
   The mother pig had three little pigs.
   And the pigs all lived together in the mother's house.

2. The mother pig did not have much money.  So, she sent the three little pigs
   away to seek their fortune.

3. The first little pig met a man carrying a bundle of straw.

4. He said to the man "Please give me that straw so that I may build a house",
   which the man did.

5. And the first little pig built his house of straw.
   "I'll be warm and cozy inside", he said.

6. The second little pig met a man with a bundle of sticks.

7. He said to the man "Please give me those sticks so that I may build a house",
   which the man also did.

8. And the second little pig built his house of sticks.
   "I'll be safe and snug inside", he said.

9. The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks.

7. He said to the man "Please give me those bricks so that I may build a house",
   which the man also did.

8. And the third little pig built his house of bricks.
   "I'm not afraid of the Big Bad Wolf", he said.

The next day the wolf went to the straw house, and said
"Little pig, little pig, let me come in".
The little pig replied "No, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin".
To which the wolf replied "Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll
blow your house in"

9. And the wolf huffed and he puffed, and blew the house down.
   And the first little pig ran to his brother's house of sticks.

So, the wolf went to the stick house, and said
"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in".
"No, not by the hair of our chinny chin chins", replied the pigs.
"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in"

10. So the wolf huffed and puffed, and blew the house down.
    And the little pigs ran to their brother's house of bricks.

So, the wolf went to the brick house, and said
"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in".
"No, not by the hair of our chinny chin chins", replied the pigs.
"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in"

11. So the wolf huffed and puffed, and huffed and puffed, but he could not
    blow the house down.

12. The wolf searched for a way into the house.  He tried the door and the
    windows, but they were all closed.  But, he saw that the chimney was
    open, and jumped on the roof to climb down it.

13. The three little pigs saw what the wolf was planning and put a big pot
    of water on the stove and made up a blazing fire.

14. The wolf slid down the chimney into the pot of water, and was promptly
    boiled up.

15. "That's the end of the Big Bad Wolf", said one of the pigs, and they all
    lived happily ever after.
